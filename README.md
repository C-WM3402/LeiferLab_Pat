Code for Pat, image analysis, and worm tracking

Image analysis code:
    getAverage.m -- imAvg = getAverage(filePath); calculates the average image for a stack of images in a folder (found by filePath variable); image names must follow the format: 'Frame_' because the code uses the 'Frame_' as a signifier that the file is a part of the image stack.
